The study included two questionnaires: Questionnaire 1 was identical for all participants  while Questionnaire 2 differentiated into six categories by sex (male and female) and three age intervals (20-29  30-69  and 70+)  with small variations in the content between conditions. HUNT Research Centre was responsible for the study  and the study received funding as part of the main data collection of the HUNT4 Survey. The study includes a wide variety of variables and instruments harmonised with the previous HUNT surveys.   hunt://NT4Emig?release=hunt-db.medisin.ntnu.no 59

With a tight focus on real-world applications  there will be large potential for applying the results in applicable products in the future.</p>\r\n   cristin://cristin.no/ 731 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id128"},{"name":"Mor-barn studien: konsekvenser ved bruk av antidepressiva i svangerskapet","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":732,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id152","longDesc":"Mor-barn studien: konsekvenser ved bruk av antidepressiva i svangerskapet    cristin://cristin.no/ 732 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id152"},{"name":"Real world learning in business education","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":733,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id1576139","longDesc":"Real world learning in business education    cristin://cristin.no/ 733 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id1576139"},{"name":"GlyTouCan","description":"GlyTouCan is the single worldwide registry of glycan (carbohydrate sugar chain) data.","version":"","date":"","instruments":"identifiers://identifiers.org/","id":734,"uri":"identifiers://identifiers.org/?instrument=glytoucan:G00054MO","uid":"identifiers-idglytoucan:G00054MO-MIR:00000608","longDesc":"GlyTouCan GlyTouCan is the single worldwide registry of glycan (carbohydrate sugar chain) data.   identifiers://identifiers.org/ 734 identifiers://identifiers.org/?instrument=glytoucan:G00054MO identifiers-idglytoucan:G00054MO-MIR:00000608"},{"name":"GnpIS","description":"GnpIS is an integrative information system focused on plants and fungal pests.

A systematic review.","description":"<p>Adolescents today are avid users of social media. According to the 2015 Pew Research Center Report, 92% of teenagers report going online daily and 24% say they go online almost constantly. Furthermore, 76% of these teenagers report they used social media (Lenhart et al., 2015). Youths therefore spend a lot of their time on and do their social activities through social media. The effects of adolescents&#96; social media use is a fairly new area of research. Studies have suggested associations between the use of social media (as independent variable) and symptoms of depression (Baker &amp; Algorta, 2016), anxiety (Keles, McCrae, &amp; Grealish, 2019), addictive behavior (Andreassen, 2015), sleep (sleep onset latency, sleep duration and sleep quality) (Garett, Liu, &amp; Young, 2018; Kaimal, Sajja, &amp; Sasangohar, 2017; Levenson, Shensa, Sidani, Colditz, &amp; Primack, 2016), alcohol consumption (Boyle, LaBrie, Froidevaux, &amp; Witkovic, 2016), isolation (Primack et al., 2017) and antisocial behavior (e.g. cyberbullying) (Hamm et al., 2015).  Thus, much previous research has focused on the negative effects of social media use. Less attention has been directed at the positive behavior being carried out on social media, as well as the possible positive effects of social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is evidence to suggest that adolescent online prosocial behavior is more prevalent than online antisocial behavior (Erreygers, Vandebosch, Vranjes, Baillien, &amp; De Witte, 2016). The relationship between social media use and prosocial behavior is not clearly established, and as of now, to my knowledge, no review or summary regarding this relationship is to be found in the literature. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online prosocial behavior is not well understood, but research on offline prosocial behavior has established a clear positive association with well-being and happiness (Aknin, Whillans, Dunn, &amp; Norton, 2019). Researchers suggest a positive feedback loop, as more feelings of well-being and happiness increase prosocial behavior. Some recent studies indicate that this relationship also pertains to online prosocial behavior (Erreygers, Vandebosch, Vranjes, Baillien, &amp; De Witte, 2019). A review of the literature on the relationship between social media use and online prosocial behavior therefore seems necessary, as that potential relationship might shed light on the potential benefits of adolescents&#96; social media use.

Researching through Karen Barad&#39;s agential realism and diffractive methods positions this research project as a performance study, i.e. building on a relational ethico-ontoepistemology. The study has so far produced the concepts of &#34;pupilmusical relations&#34; (Kvile &amp; Christophersen, 2023) and &#34;childmusicking&#34; (Kvile, 2024).

In the discussion about the biggest challenges in digitalizing of schools, a common line of argumentation has been that the problem is not access to technology, but what teachers, on all levels, can do to make sure that the technology available brings pedagogical value added. For a decade or two, that discussion was a good deal less audible in teacher education (TE), but has lately started to incorporate them, too. Without challenging this argument, in this study we take a different stance: Our point of departure is that availability of and access to technology in general, and the kind of technology in particular, do matter to development of professional digital competence, in schools as well as in TE. From this perspective, it is the decision making (policies and practice) regarding educational technology (edtech) procurement on both contexts that plays a pivotal role for the leaders’ room of manoeuvre in facilitation of relevant competence development. Our research question is: how does management in TE and schools evaluate the impact of public authorities and educational technology (providers) on development of professional digital competence (PDC)? Many factors especially in public but also in private sector have an effect on development of PDC of teachers. The actualization and relative weight of these factors in competence development, are mediated by management decisions, in TE and schools. Thus, we shall explore how management (those with decision-making power regarding edtech procurement) in TE and schools, view the relative and factual impact of the two type of factors. The pilot study will bring new knowledge in the fields of development of teachers’ PDC and governance of digital development in education. Our hypothesis specifically concerns the direct and indirect impact of management’s decision-making regarding edtech procurements, thus adding the effect of private sector, and private-public collaboration to the traditional view of sole public authorities’ responsibility to this end. The 12-month pilot project will be implemented in 2020, mainly as a qualitative interview study, in collaboration between five institutions in UH-NettVest: UiS (coord), NLA, HVL, UiB, and HiVo.

In the discussion about the biggest challenges in digitalizing of schools  a common line of argumentation has been that the problem is not access to technology  but what teachers  on all levels  can do to make sure that the technology available brings pedagogical value added. For a decade or two  that discussion was a good deal less audible in teacher education (TE)  but has lately started to incorporate them  too. Without challenging this argument  in this study we take a different stance: Our point of departure is that availability of and access to technology in general  and the kind of technology in particular  do matter to development of professional digital competence  in schools as well as in TE. From this perspective  it is the decision making (policies and practice) regarding educational technology (edtech) procurement on both contexts that plays a pivotal role for the leaders’ room of manoeuvre in facilitation of relevant competence development. Our research question is: how does management in TE and schools evaluate the impact of public authorities and educational technology (providers) on development of professional digital competence (PDC)? Many factors especially in public but also in private sector have an effect on development of PDC of teachers. The actualization and relative weight of these factors in competence development  are mediated by management decisions  in TE and schools. Thus  we shall explore how management (those with decision-making power regarding edtech procurement) in TE and schools  view the relative and factual impact of the two type of factors. The pilot study will bring new knowledge in the fields of development of teachers’ PDC and governance of digital development in education. Our hypothesis specifically concerns the direct and indirect impact of management’s decision-making regarding edtech procurements  thus adding the effect of private sector  and private-public collaboration to the traditional view of sole public authorities’ responsibility to this end. The 12-month pilot project will be implemented in 2020  mainly as a qualitative interview study  in collaboration between five institutions in UH-NettVest: UiS (coord)  NLA  HVL  UiB  and HiVo. The partners have complementary competence and experience in regards the research question  to implement the project with high quality. The findings will be published as an article in an international scientific journal and a summary in Norwegian. Funding for a main project will be sought from the Research Council (NFR) in 2020.

The analyses are based on data from the Norwegian Patient Registry for the period 2012–2016. The use of health services was analysed on the basis of hospital referral areas, i.e. where the patients lived rather than where they received treatment. For degenerative joint disease, we investigated osteoarthritis of the hip, knee and thumb for variations in surgery rates between hospital referral areas. The surgery rate is the number of operations per 100 000 population. For osteoarthritis of the knee and meniscal degeneration, we also looked at variation in the use of arthroscopy. Correspondingly, surgery rates for fractures (wrist, ankle, hip, shoulder and clavicular fractures), lower back complaints (prolapse and spinal stenosis) and anterior cruciate ligament injuries were also analysed. For other lower back pain and concussion, we investigated admission rates (number of admissions per 100,000 population).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Results</strong> The analyses show that the variation in the use of health services was particularly high for arthroscopy as treatment for degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis and meniscal injuries).

However, the high variation between hospital referral areas shows that no professional consensus existed on the indications for this procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found considerable variation in surgical treatment of wrist fractures, lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Private treatment providers (institutions under contracts subject to competitive tendering and/or renegotiation and specialists in private practice under public funding agreements) were used for operations for back complaints, anterior cruciate ligament injuries and arthroscopies for degenerative knee complaints in particular.

This  in combination with a new library of the deep sea annelid barcodes publicly available in BOLD  will provide a solid basis for future research and nature management in the deep Norwegian waters. Results of the project will be presented during three national and two international scientific conferences and will be available to the general public via the project blog and creation of the selected species pages with illustrations and descriptions freely available online for a wide audience.</p>\r\n   cristin://cristin.no/ 1313 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2044702"},{"name":"nasjonalt_barnehofteregister","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"helsedata://nasjonalt_barnehofteregister?instrument=","id":1315,"uri":"helsedata://nasjonalt_barnehofteregister?instrument=","uid":"project:undefined","longDesc":"nasjonalt_barnehofteregister    helsedata://nasjonalt_barnehofteregister?instrument= 1315 helsedata://nasjonalt_barnehofteregister?instrument= project:undefined"},{"name":"STEMM-CCS (Strategies for the Environmental Monitoring of Marine Carbon Capture and Storage)","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":1316,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id2044705","longDesc":"STEMM-CCS (Strategies for the Environmental Monitoring of Marine Carbon Capture and Storage)    cristin://cristin.no/ 1316 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2044705"},{"name":"Tree of Life","description":"The Tree of Life Web Project (ToL) is a collaborative effort of biologists and nature enthusiasts from around the world.

A key question will be to determine the extent of complete degradation  as opposed to fragmentation and accumulation of non-degraded or non-degradable degradable residues. We will also depict costs/benefits and environmental consequences of increased use of selected products and materials for environment  climate  industry and commerce for contrasting scenarios of an early adaptation period.</p>\r\n   cristin://cristin.no/ 1366 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2044915"},{"name":"VFDB Gene","description":"VFDB is a repository of virulence factors (VFs) of pathogenic bacteria.This collection references VF genes.","version":"","date":"","instruments":"identifiers://identifiers.org/","id":1368,"uri":"identifiers://identifiers.org/?instrument=vfdb.gene:VFG2154","uid":"identifiers-idvfdb.gene:VFG2154-MIR:00000472","longDesc":"VFDB Gene VFDB is a repository of virulence factors (VFs) of pathogenic bacteria.This collection references VF genes.   identifiers://identifiers.org/ 1368 identifiers://identifiers.org/?instrument=vfdb.gene:VFG2154 identifiers-idvfdb.gene:VFG2154-MIR:00000472"},{"name":"VFDB Genus","description":"VFDB is a repository of virulence factors (VFs) of pathogenic bacteria.This collection references VF information by Genus.","version":"","date":"","instruments":"identifiers://identifiers.org/","id":1369,"uri":"identifiers://identifiers.org/?instrument=vfdb.genus:Chlamydia","uid":"identifiers-idvfdb.genus:Chlamydia-MIR:00000471","longDesc":"VFDB Genus VFDB is a repository of virulence factors (VFs) of pathogenic bacteria.This collection references VF information by Genus.   identifiers://identifiers.org/ 1369 identifiers://identifiers.org/?instrument=vfdb.genus:Chlamydia identifiers-idvfdb.genus:Chlamydia-MIR:00000471"},{"name":"VGNC","description":"The Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) is an extension of the established HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) project that names human genes.

During the training  we presented the project objectives and the Toolkit publication was introduced to the participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>During 2019 01 01- 2019 05 30 period  360 pupils of different age from Lithuania and Latvia took part in the program that consisted of a total of 12 hrs of practical learning activities for each group. The toolkit was improved based on the feedback and proposals received from the teachers after this piloting stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Toolkit  project goals and the experience of project partners in the field of drowning prevention were presented during the practical conference which took place in Vilnius  on June 12  2019. A total of 81 participants attended the conference: administrations of the swimming pools  swimming coaches  swimming instructors  the representatives of municipalities and of their public health offices from Lithuania and Latvia  project partners from Finland and Norway. The event helped to discuss the ideas for improving swimming teaching programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Latvian version <a href=\"https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url&#61;https%3A%2F%2Flvjc.lt%2Fmedia%2Ffiles%2Fpatarim%25C5%25B3_rinkinys_aquatic_life_LV.pdf&amp;data&#61;02%7C01%7Cdagmar.g.dahl%40nord.no%7C2b3d48fb7e3145334acd08d738149b5d%7Cfed13d9f21df485d909a231f3c6d16f0%7C1%7C1%7C637039534040185881&amp;sdata&#61;mAIQETD6CtO9MaS5IP8ia9K2a2KWOvJ%2B6XLvwEGzht0%3D&amp;reserved&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lvjc.lt/media/files/patarim%C5%B3_rinkinys_aquatic_life_LV.pdf</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>English version <a href=\"https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url&#61;https%3A%2F%2Flvjc.lt%2Fmedia%2Ffiles%2Fpatarim%25C5%25B3_rinkinys_aquatic_life_EN.pdf&amp;data&#61;02%7C01%7Cdagmar.g.dahl%40nord.no%7C2b3d48fb7e3145334acd08d738149b5d%7Cfed13d9f21df485d909a231f3c6d16f0%7C1%7C1%7C637039534040185881&amp;sdata&#61;qp3kdZNH2dpzAmO8%2B%2Bc3pBqnxwoQNj%2FYTNRzIM7KoaQ%3D&amp;reserved&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lvjc.lt/media/files/patarim%C5%B3_rinkinys_aquatic_life_EN.pdf</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n   cristin://cristin.no/ 1421 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2046508"},{"name":"Literacies for health and life skills (HLS)","description":"<p>‘Literacies for Health and Life Skills’ (HLS)The background for this project is shaped by two major concerns: societal concerns over youngpeople’s health and body dissatisfaction, and concerns for curriculum renewal where a new cross-curricular theme ‘Public Health and Life Skills’ (PHLS) is introduced in school.

Before interventions aiming to increase PA in young children can be initiated  longitudinal research is required to identify factors influencing the development in PA over time  including how PA develops by individual characteristics such as sex  age  weight status/BMI  and fundamental motor skills (FMS). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aims of this research project was to investigate longitudinal development in PA and FMS from preschool to primary school  how PA develops by season  and investigate bi-directional  prospective associations between PA and FMS development and PA and BMI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far  two research papers is published on this material. The firs one is based on three repeated measurements of PA throughout the baseline year (10 months). Here we found that children were more physically active and less sedentary during spring and summer months when compared to the rest of the year. In the two-year follow-up study  we found that baseline moderate to vigorous PA predicted improved FMS two years later  but baseline FMS did not predict future PA levels.</p>\r\n   cristin://cristin.no/ 1452 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2047017"},{"name":"Improved management of patients with fibromyalgia: Evaluation of an integrated care model","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":1453,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id2047021","longDesc":"Improved management of patients with fibromyalgia: Evaluation of an integrated care model    cristin://cristin.no/ 1453 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2047021"},{"name":"Effect Evaluation of IPS - a long-term follow-up study","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":1454,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id2047221","longDesc":"Effect Evaluation of IPS - a long-term follow-up study    cristin://cristin.no/ 1454 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2047221"},{"name":"Multivariate pattern analysis of accelerometry physical activity data","description":"<p>Accelerometer-derived physical activity is often broadly represented across a spectrum of time spent in different intensities (sedentary (SED), light physical activity (LPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA) and/or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).

Several studies in other countries have shown that women attribute long-term dissatisfaction and mental distress related to childbirth more to the care they received, particularly interactions with health providers, than to any physical trauma experienced. Researchers in Norway have demonstrated that some groups of immigrant women, particularly from non-western countries, have increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes, such as hyperemesis, foetal distress, caesarean section and preterm birth, compared to the ethnic Norwegian population. However, the mechanisms behind these associations remain largely unknown. They may be the result of differential care provided to immigrant women, but studies addressing quality of care in Norway have generally excluded immigrant women. In 2016, in the central Norway region, one-quarter of births (25%) were to women born outside of Norway, and 21% of births were to women born outside of Norway and other high-income country contexts including the neighbouring Scandinavian countries. Therefore, research addressing the health of immigrant women in this region is increasingly relevant and needed. This study will address existing scientific gaps by investigating the satisfaction of immigrant women with the care they receive during childbirth at St. Olavs university hospital. We will use a questionnaire, provided in eight languages, to compare birth experience, satisfaction with care, communication with health providers, and other factors, between and within groups of immigrant-born and Norwegian-born women giving birth at St. Olavs university hospital.

In the discussion about the biggest challenges in digitalizing of schools, a common line of argumentation has been that the problem is not access to technology, but what teachers, on all levels, can do to make sure that the technology available brings pedagogical value added. For a decade or two, that discussion was a good deal less audible in teacher education (TE), but has lately started to incorporate them, too. Without challenging this argument, in this study we take a different stance: Our point of departure is that availability of and access to technology in general, and the kind of technology in particular, do matter to development of professional digital competence, in schools as well as in TE. From this perspective, it is the decision making (policies and practice) regarding educational technology (edtech) procurement on both contexts that plays a pivotal role for the leaders’ room of manoeuvre in facilitation of relevant competence development. Our research question is: how does management in TE and schools evaluate the impact of public authorities and educational technology (providers) on development of professional digital competence (PDC)? Many factors especially in public but also in private sector have an effect on development of PDC of teachers. The actualization and relative weight of these factors in competence development, are mediated by management decisions, in TE and schools. Thus, we shall explore how management (those with decision-making power regarding edtech procurement) in TE and schools, view the relative and factual impact of the two type of factors. The pilot study will bring new knowledge in the fields of development of teachers’ PDC and governance of digital development in education.

However, their effectiveness remains the subject of debate in both the policy and academic communities. International organizations that conduct peace operations, like the United Nations, have come under increasing pressure to justify their impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although various initiatives are underway to improve the ability of these organizations to assess their performance, there is a lack of independent, external research about the effectiveness of peace operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address this gap, the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) together with 40 partners from across the globe have established an international network to undertake research into the effectiveness of peace operations. Of these, 18 are included in the NORGLOBAL EPON project. The overall aim of EPON is to enhance the effectiveness of international peace operations, by enabling and supporting collaborative research. The results of these research studies will be shared at seminars in Oslo, Addis Ababa (African Union), Brussels (European Union) and in New York (United Nations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time, EPON will produce a substantial amount of mission-specific research studies, which will be a rich source for further research, for instance, for identifying common factors that influence the effectiveness of peace operations across a broad range of cases.

However  their effectiveness remains the subject of debate in both the policy and academic communities. International organizations that conduct peace operations  like the United Nations  have come under increasing pressure to justify their impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although various initiatives are underway to improve the ability of these organizations to assess their performance  there is a lack of independent  external research about the effectiveness of peace operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address this gap  the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) together with 40 partners from across the globe have established an international network to undertake research into the effectiveness of peace operations. Of these  18 are included in the NORGLOBAL EPON project. The overall aim of EPON is to enhance the effectiveness of international peace operations  by enabling and supporting collaborative research. The results of these research studies will be shared at seminars in Oslo  Addis Ababa (African Union)  Brussels (European Union) and in New York (United Nations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time  EPON will produce a substantial amount of mission-specific research studies  which will be a rich source for further research  for instance  for identifying common factors that influence the effectiveness of peace operations across a broad range of cases.

In fact, humans are not limited to one language, but can acquire several under the right conditions. Nevertheless, bi- and multilingualism (henceforth referred to as multilingualism, unless further specified) is not an <em>either-or</em> pheno­menon, as multi­lingual minds may (and typically do) undergo numerous changes across the lifespan, as a result of linguistic and non-linguistic factors. This means that <strong>multilingual minds comprise dyna­mic linguistic systems</strong>, as co-existing languages affect each other in a multi­tude of ways, both in the acquisition process and beyond. The AcqVA Aurora Center will conduct ecolo­gi­cally valid research, re­flect­ing today’s globa­lized world, where learning mul­tiple lan­guages at various points in the lifetime has become increasingly common.

The three domains will be studied within four cross-cutting themes, focusing on inter­related issues of multi­lingualism: 1) how linguistic and non-linguistic experiential factors shape linguistic and cognitive outcomes, 2) how multiple languages in the same mind influence each other, 3) how clo­sely related varieties co-existing in the same mind are processed, and 4) how representing and juggling multiple languages manifest and result in adaptations at the neurological and domain-general cognitive levels.

The second hypothesis states that risk factors such as comorbid diseases  health-related behavior  and socio-economic factors p</p>\r\n   cristin://cristin.no/ 1898 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2062449"},{"name":"Tailored music therapy for persons with dementia together with a relative","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":1899,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id2062453","longDesc":"Tailored music therapy for persons with dementia together with a relative    cristin://cristin.no/ 1899 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2062453"},{"name":"The origins and emergence of operational art","description":"<p>This thesis examines the origins and emergence of operational art.

Extensive experimental activities with strong coupling to model development of all the main topics  aim for results  methods and numerical tools that will extend the competence of all users in the hydrogen pipeline chain represented in HyLINE.<br />\r\nThe expected outcomes of the HyLINE will serve as a scientific foundation for future development of standards and practices for pipeline transport of high pressure hydrogen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n   cristin://cristin.no/ 1929 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2062917"},{"name":"Factors Influencing Inter-Rater Reliability in Grant Peer Review","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":1930,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id2062988","longDesc":"Factors Influencing Inter-Rater Reliability in Grant Peer Review    cristin://cristin.no/ 1930 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2062988"},{"name":"Feedback to improve agreement in grant peer review: A randomized controlled tria","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":1931,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id2062989","longDesc":"Feedback to improve agreement in grant peer review: A randomized controlled tria    cristin://cristin.no/ 1931 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2062989"},{"name":"Reviewer training for improving grant and journal peer review: A systematic review","description":"","version":"","date":"","instruments":"cristin://cristin.no/","id":1932,"uri":"cristin://cristin.no/","uid":"cristin-id2062990","longDesc":"Reviewer training for improving grant and journal peer review: A systematic review    cristin://cristin.no/ 1932 cristin://cristin.no/ cristin-id2062990"},{"name":"Making tutorial films on picturebooks","description":"<p>This project will discuss learning outcomes from a teaching unit in a 15 ECT course aimed at 50 primary school teachers upgrading their competences within the school subject Norwegian.

The innovations will be characterized by high retrofitability, maintainability and offer ship owners a return-on-investment of 400% due to fuel and operational cost savings. The proposed renewable-energy-based propulsion innovation is the bio-mimetic dynamic wing mounted at the ship bow to augment ship propulsion in moderate and higher sea states, capturing wave energy, producing extra thrust and damping ship motions. The proposed power generation innovation is based on the idea of achieving ultra-high energy conversion efficiency by precisely controlling the engine for achieving radically reduced emissions.

According to previous research, it has been shown in lab conditions that exposing the food samples to CO<sub>2</sub> before packaging will increase the shelf-life and preserve the quality of muscle food for a longer period, without influencing taste and visual impression. Longer shelf-life is correlated with increased utilization of the raw material, food products and enables these products to reach new markets. Through previous work, lack of technology for on line industrial full-scale SGS treatment during production has been identified to be the main obstacle for implementing SGS treatment in the food industry.

According to previous research  it has been shown in lab conditions that exposing the food samples to CO<sub>2</sub> before packaging will increase the shelf-life and preserve the quality of muscle food for a longer period  without influencing taste and visual impression. Longer shelf-life is correlated with increased utilization of the raw material  food products and enables these products to reach new markets. Through previous work  lack of technology for on line industrial full-scale SGS treatment during production has been identified to be the main obstacle for implementing SGS treatment in the food industry.
